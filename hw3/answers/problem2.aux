\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.1}We have chosen the array representation of a polynomial: RatNum[] coeffs, where coeffs[i] stores the coefficient of the term of exponent i. An alternative data representation is the list-of-terms representation: List<Term> terms, where each Term object stores the termâ€™s RatNum coefficient and integer exponent. The beauty of the ADT methodology isthat we can switch from one representation to the other without affecting the clients of our RatPoly. Briefly list the advantages and disadvantages of the array representation versus the list-ofterms representation. }{1}{}\protected@file@percent }
