You may also use u[i] to retrieve the coefficient at power i of polynomial u, as well as c * $x^{i}$ to denote the single-term polynomial of degree i and coefficient c.}{1}{}\protected@file@percent }

For the proof question, you do not need to handle division by zero; however, you will need to do so in the Java program. Important: write your pseudocode, invariants, and proofs first, then write the Java code. Going backwards will be harder.}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
